# Neo Zen  

> ⚠️ **Compatibility Notice:**  
> Due to recent changes in **Zen v1.14**, Neo Zen currently maintains compatibility **only with Zen v1.13.2**.  
> This is a temporary measure while we await updates from Zen developers to resolve or revise the new light/dark theme behavior introduced in v1.14.

Welcome to **Neo Zen** – a sleek, futuristic theme for Zen Browser that blends modern design with mindful simplicity.  
With **innovative features, refined UI enhancements, and adaptive styling**, Neo Zen creates a seamless, distraction-free browsing experience.

*Neo Zen works with [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine)... sometimes.*

## 🏆 Credits  

Neo Zen's **tab transitions and animations** come directly from the **Nebula** theme — thanks to the generosity of its developer.  
Huge thanks to **[JustAdumbPrsn](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn)**, the creator of **Nebula**, for allowing the use of their code and contributing to a smoother browsing experience!  

👉 Check out **Nebula** here: [Zen Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Nebula)

Neo Zen has been shaped by countless small pieces — some experimental, some forgotten, but all appreciated.  
While this project is **no longer actively maintained by me**, it’s only right to acknowledge the creators whose work made an impact:

- **📄 PDF Viewer** – Integrated from the [Natsumi Browser](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/Natsumi-Browser), created by **greeeen-dev**.  
  A clean and functional viewer that greatly enhanced document support in Neo Zen.

- **🗂️ Tab Group System** – Based on code by [**Anoms12**](https://github.com/Anoms12).  
  Their implementation helped lay the foundation for Neo Zen’s tab group styling and behavior.

- **🧪 Miscellaneous Contributions** – Some features were added through collaboration, experimentation, or inherited code.  
  If you recognize something you authored, **thank you** — even if it was forgotten in the shuffle.

If anyone wants to **pick up where this left off**, contributions and community-led updates are **welcomed** 💡
